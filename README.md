# jass-kit-py

Base components to program agents for the game of
[Jass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jass) (Schieber): the rules, the game
state, the observation a player has of it, an arena to let agents play against
each other, and a service to make an agent available over the network.

This package is intentionally small and has no machine learning dependencies -
numpy is all it needs. Writing an agent means implementing two methods.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .                 # the game
pip install -e '.[service]'      # additionally flask, to serve an agent
```

## Writing an agent

Derive from `Agent` and implement the two decisions of a Schieber game:

```python
import numpy as np
from jass.agents.agent import Agent
from jass.game.game_observation import GameObservation
from jass.game.rule_schieber import RuleSchieber
from jass.game.const import PUSH, DIAMONDS


class MyAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self):
        self._rule = RuleSchieber()
        self._rng = np.random.default_rng()

    def action_trump(self, obs: GameObservation) -> int:
        # obs.forehand == -1 means we are the forehand and may push
        if obs.forehand == -1 and self._rng.random() < 0.5:
            return PUSH
        return DIAMONDS

    def action_play_card(self, obs: GameObservation) -> int:
        # only ever play a card the rules allow
        valid_cards = self._rule.get_valid_cards_from_obs(obs)
        return int(self._rng.choice(np.flatnonzero(valid_cards)))
```

`AgentRandomSchieber` is a complete random agent to compare against, and
`examples/arena/arena_play.py` shows a simple heuristic agent.

The two methods return **encoded integers**, described below. Returning an
invalid card is an error; `get_valid_cards_from_obs` tells you which cards are
allowed, and using it is the easiest way to be correct.

### What the agent sees

`GameObservation` is the game **from one player's point of view**: their own
hand, the tricks played so far, who dealt, what trump is, how many points each
team has. It deliberately does not contain the other players' hands.

`GameState` is the complete state including all four hands. An agent that gets
it would be cheating, which is why it is a separate class and why cheating
agents derive from `AgentCheating` instead. Such agents are useful as an upper
bound on how well one could play, not as opponents.

## Letting agents play

```python
from jass.arena.arena import Arena

arena = Arena(nr_games_to_play=1000)
arena.set_players(my_agent, opponent, my_agent, opponent)   # north, east, south, west
arena.play_all_games()
print(arena.points_team_0.sum(), arena.points_team_1.sum())
```

Partners sit across from each other: north and south are team 0, east and west
are team 1. 157 points are distributed per game, so a result is usually reported
as a percentage of 157.

## Serving an agent over the network

`jass.service` wraps agents in a flask application, which is how they are
deployed and how the online platform reaches them:

```python
from jass.service.player_service_app import PlayerServiceApp

app = PlayerServiceApp('my_service')
app.add_player('my_agent', MyAgent())
# flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

See `examples/service/player_service.py`. `AgentByNetwork` is the counterpart: an
agent that forwards the decisions to such a service, so a remote agent can play
in a local arena.

## Encodings

Getting these wrong is the most common source of confusion.

**Cards** are 0..35, grouped by suit and descending by rank within a suit:

| Range | Suit | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0..8 | diamonds | DA, DK, DQ, DJ, D10, D9, D8, D7, D6 |
| 9..17 | hearts | HA .. H6 |
| 18..26 | spades | SA .. S6 |
| 27..35 | clubs | CA .. C6 |

A hand is a one-hot array of 36 entries, not a list of card numbers.
`jass.game.game_util` converts between the representations
(`convert_one_hot_encoded_cards_to_str_encoded_list` and friends).

**Trump** is 0..5: diamonds, hearts, spades, clubs, obenabe (4), unenufe (5).

**Push** is the constant `PUSH`, which is *not* 6 - use the constant. It may only
be returned when `obs.forehand == -1`, that is when you are the forehand player
and the decision has not been passed to you already.

**Players** are north 0, east 1, south 2, west 3, and play goes
counter-clockwise, so `next_player[NORTH]` is west. The `next_player` and
`partner_player` tables in `jass.game.const` avoid arithmetic mistakes here.

| `jass.game` | State, observation, rules (`RuleSchieber`), the simulation (`GameSim`), constants and conversion helpers |
| `jass.agents` | The `Agent` and `AgentCheating` interfaces, random agents, `AgentByNetwork` |
| `jass.arena` | Playing many games between agents, with card dealing strategies |
| `jass.service` | Flask application to serve agents over REST |

`Overview.md` and the `*.puml` files hold class diagrams of the game classes.

python -m unittest discover -s test -p "*test*.py"
```

This package is the base; machine learning, training and evaluation live
elsewhere. See
[jass-docs](https://github.com/thomas-koller/jass-docs) for the overview.
Note that this package stays deliberately free of those dependencies, so that
writing an agent needs nothing but numpy.
